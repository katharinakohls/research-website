          <h4 id="theses">Offered: Technical Topics</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>5G SEPP</strong>, Master Thesis/Internship<br>Use the Open5Gs implementation of a 5G mobile network and extend it by a SEPP implementation. What is 5G? It's the upcoming new mobile generation. What's SEPP? It's a new proxy that enables secure communication between different 5G networks. Such inter-network communication is needed roaming, but also in other standard use cases. The thesis includes the setup of two virtual Open5Gs setups and the implementation of the inter-network connection between both.</li>

            <li><strong>eSIM Security Testing</strong>, Bachelor Thesis, Internship<br>In the future, eSIMs will replace physical SIM cards. They equip mobile devices with options to directly program all relevant information instead of switching cards. To this end, the OS of a phone must provide suitable interfaces and functions to adjust the credentials on the eSIM. The thesis focuses on security testing for eSIMs. This includes the definition of test cases, the implementation of a test framework, and an experimental evaluation of the results.</li>

            <li><strong>Implementation of a Signal Strength Measurement App</strong>, Bachelor Thesis, Internship<br>Implement an Android app that allows to measure the signal strength of surrounding mobile network base stations. The thesis includes the design and implementation of the app as well as real-world measurements of signal strengths in an example area.</li>
           
            <li><strong>End-to-End Traffic Analysis Attacks in Mobile Nstworks</strong>, Bachelor Thesis<br>Design and apply end-to-end traffic analysis attacks on 5G mobile traffic. The thesis focuses on the experimental evaluation of statistical attacks and their feasibility.</li>

            <li><strong>Remote SIM Implementation</strong>, Master Thesis<br>Integrate a <a href="https://osmocom.org/projects/osmo-remsim/wiki">remote SIM</a> setup into <a href="https://www.srslte.com/">SRSRAN</a> that allows to switch between multiple physical SIM cards within the software stack implementation of SRSRAN. Verify the correct behavior and conduct measurements in this setup.</li>

            <!-- <li><strong>Design and Implementation of a Mobile Network Measurement Setup</strong>, Bachelor/Master Thesis<br>Design and implement an experimental setup using a USRP, mobile phone, and LTE software stack to record and analyze mobile network traffic. The thesis includes creating the experimental setup as, managing a set of measurements, and analyzing the resulting traces.</li> -->

          <h4 id="theses">Offered: User-Focused</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Which factors motivate potential providers to contribute to an open 5G network?</strong>, Bachelor/Master Thesis/Internship<br>A core idea of the open 5G network project is that *everyone* can contribute to this network as a provider by obtaining and running the required hardware. In this project, you identify the factors that influence whether potential providers contribute to this network. As part of the project, you will develop a technical understanding of 5G and map out the benefits (e.g., financial compensation) that can motivate potential providers to contribute to an open 5G network. Furthermore, you will identify potential risks (e.g., legal) and necessary investments for providers (e.g., required hardware, energy consumption, setup and maintenance activities).</li>

            <li><strong>Which factors determine whether users make use of an open 5G network?</strong>, Bachelor/Master Thesis/Internship<br>
              A core idea of the open 5G network project is that *everyone* can use this open network by obtaining a SIM card for it or by using an eSIM with the corresponding settings. This project will identify and map out the factors influencing whether potential end-users will take advantage of the open network.  As part of the project, you will develop a technical understanding of the features, advantages and guarantees that an open 5G infrastructure can offer and explore which properties matter to potential providers and users. Furthermore, you will combine a literature review with interviews to analyse how motivational factors influence adoption and usage. </li>

            <li><strong>People's understanding, expectations and assumptions of 4G properties</strong>, Bachelor/Master Thesis/Internship<br>
              People use mobile networks every day. However, little is known about how the general population's understanding of mobile network properties. In this project, you will shed light on this matter and explore people's privacy and security assumptions about the use of mobile networks. Potential questions include whether people know what traces they leave behind when using mobile networks, whether they are aware of what a provider knows about them, and whether they are concerned about the amount of information providers can collect. Similarly, you can address whether and how much trust they place in providers and how users' behavioural patterns are affected by their assumptions about mobile networks' security and privacy properties. </li>
           
            <li><strong>How does anonymity in open 5G networks affect people's online behaviour?</strong>, Bachelor/Master Thesis/Internship<br>
              Compared to current commonplace 4G networks,  5G networks can offer stronger security and privacy guarantees. So far, little is known about the value that the general population attributes to potential network properties such as the user's anonymity. In this project, you will explore the role that anonymity can play in using (mobile) networks.  In particular, you explore how behavioural patterns are expected to be affected by anonymous usage. Related questions can also be addressed. For instance, you can explore to what extend users are aware of the (lack of) anonymity in current mobile networks and whether the possibility to stay anonymous plays a role in choosing a network provider.</li>

            <li><strong>When users are providers</strong>, Bachelor/Master Thesis/Internship<br>
              Just like TOR, future 5G networks offer users the possibility to also act as providers. Aside from setting up the required hardware, this also entails that strangers' network traffic moves through their own personal setup. Unfortunately, not much is known about how individual users who act as providers experience this usage of their infrastructure by strangers. In this study, you explore the experience, concerns, and motivational factors that are at play when individuals decide to share their network with others.</li>

            <li><strong>The power of open 5G providers</strong>, Bachelor/Master Thesis/Internship<br>
              With the specification of 5G, open mobile networks have become a real possibility. Everyone can act as a provider in such an open 5G network by obtaining and running the required hardware. However, acting as a provider comes with great power. In principle, providers might choose to filter and restrict the sites that end users can visit (e.g., blocking access to competitors). In this project, you will explore providers' power in open 5G networks. You will analyse the risks that come with allowing everyone to act as a provider and establish a list of recommendations about how to mitigate these risks.</li>
